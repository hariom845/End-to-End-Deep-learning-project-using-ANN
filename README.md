# End-to-End Deep Learning Project using ANN for prediction of Salary

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project is about building and using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for prediction tasks. It includes:

- Data preprocessing (encoding, scaling, etc.)  
- Model building, training, and hyperparameter tuning with ANN  
- Saving the trained model and required encoders / scalers  
- Notebooks for experimentation & prediction
